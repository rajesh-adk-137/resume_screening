# Early Resume Category Predictor

## ⚠️ **Important Note: No Relevance to the Final Project**

This folder is **not relevant** to the final implementation of our project and can be ignored for practical purposes. However, it is retained here as an early experiment, showcasing exploratory work that may serve as a learning resource for others.

---

## Overview

This folder contains:

- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) demonstrating the training and evaluation of various models to predict resume categories. The dataset used is the [Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com) from Kaggle.
- A synthetic resume dataset (`.csv`) created for testing various resume formats within predefined categories.  
  **Note:** This synthetic dataset is of moderate quality and was not used in the final implementation of our project.

## Models Explored

This experiment involved training multiple models for resume category prediction, including:

### 1. **LSTM Model**
- Achieved **97.93% accuracy** on the validation set.
- Provided strong results in predicting resume categories.

### 2. **Other Machine Learning Models**
Several models from the scikit-learn library were trained and evaluated using the `OneVsRestClassifier` strategy. Below is a summary of their performance:

| Model                               | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors                 | 91.98%            | 83.45%         |
| Logistic Regression                 | 100.00%           | 94.48%         |
| Support Vector Machine (SVC)        | 99.11%            | 94.48%         |
| Random Forest                       | 100.00%           | 96.55%         |

These results highlight the potential of these models for achieving high accuracy in resume category classification.

## Educational Value

This experiment, while exploratory, highlights:

- The process of developing and evaluating machine learning models for resume classification.
- Insights into preprocessing, feature extraction, and validation techniques specific to resume data.

## Why It Was Not Included in the Final Project

The final project, **ResuMatch: Automated Resume Screening System**, went beyond category prediction to focus on:

- Extracting key information from resumes (e.g., skills, experience, education).
- Comparing resumes to job descriptions using semantic similarity measures.
- Implementing advanced rule-based and transformer-based models (e.g., spaCy and sentence transformers).

The models trained here were limited to predicting resume categories and did not align with these broader objectives.
